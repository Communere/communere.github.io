Communere are a truly remote workforce, we have daily meetings and catch ups throughout the day and week, although the remote nature of our business allows us to be truly global. It is estimated that by 2029, 38% of the workforce around the world will be remote working. We will explore some of the benefits to remote working and the benefits to Communere.

## Promotes a positive work-life balance

A work-life balance is a benefit that a lot of employees value as a top priority when choosing the best place to work. The ability to be able to take and pick up children from school, going to a fitness class early or at lunch time, going to the doctors or making it to the supermarket before the mad evening rush, or just the ability to be home when for an important delivery. These are all things that make life a lot easier, and are all possible when working remotely. These may sound like small things, although it makes a huge amount of difference in the long run.

## Increased Productivity

This can be one of the biggest fears for an organisation while transitioning to a remote workforce; how can we tell that our employees are working hard if we can’t see them? According to a study conducted by Stanford University, most organisations that have adopted remote working have found that there has been an increase in productivity. Without the many distractions, remote workers can focus entirely on their daily tasks, allowing for quiet time, people can focus entirely on their projects. Thus, increasing productivity in the long run.

## Money Saving (for the organisation)

Many remote workers use their own equipment, this is Wi-Fi, heating, among others which have a big impact in the long run for saving money as an organisation. The company does not need to rent large, expensive offices; this is one of the biggest savings an organisation can make over a long period of time.

Finding the best talent globally with ample experience is a much easier task when you are looking for remote employees. Most remote employees have years of experience in an office. Therefore, the upskilling time is reduced which also saves companies a large amount of money in the long run. The Global Workforce has a table of savings for an organisation per year for a remote emplyee:

- Circa £1,857 is saved per remote employee in reduced office sizes and utility bills
- £3,560 is saved per remote employee by increasing productivity
- £464 per remote employee by decreasing turnover through increased flexibility and happiness
- £681 per remote employee due to the fact that remote workers are less likely to take sick days
  Total savings: £6562.00 per year per employee

## Money Saving (for employees)

The money saving doesn’t stop with the employers, working remotely can save individuals thousands each year. According to Global Workplace Analytics, people who work from home half time can save between £1,500 to £5,000 a year, that is double for full time remote employees. The savings for employees can be found on petrol, the running of their cars on a daily basis, rail or bus travel, parking. There is also a reduction in daily coffee spending i.e. the daily Starbucks on the way to work, as well as lunches bought in supermarkets etc. Big savings can be found in child care if people are able to pick up their children this can reduce childcare costs, as well as the savings on office attire. Over time, these savings can be significant and allow for a healthier, happier work life balance.

## Good for the Environment

It is vital for organisations to reduce their carbon footprint. According to the US environmental protection agency a “a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This assumes the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon and drives around 11,500 miles per year. Every gallon of gasoline burned creates about 8,887 grams of CO2”.Remote workers on the other hand are not responsible for adding to the daily carbon emissions by car commuting, which could be up to 30 miles per day on average, saving up to 7,830 miles on a cars emissions for an average working year of 261 days (depending on how much they use their car of course). You can track your daily emissions with Map my Emissions. Working remotely can help:

- Less traffic pollution caused by fewer employees driving to work.
- People being less inclined to purchasing throwaway cups or containers on breaks.
- Conserving office space.

Being in control of factors that can damage the environment (such as office supplies and the use of lights)

Remote employees are less inclined to use one use plastics and paper cups for their morning coffees, as well as consume less food that comes in plastic containers, with plastic bags among others.
