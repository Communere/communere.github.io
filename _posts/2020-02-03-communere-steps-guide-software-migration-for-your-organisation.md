A legacy system is a computing software / hardware system that a company uses, despite it being outdated. The system is still being used by a company, although it still meets the needs of what the company designed it for, it is not a scalable system that enables growth both with, and for the organisation. The system will continue to do what it has always done, although it will never do any more than it was originally tasked to do. The downfall of a legacy system is that it cannot interact efficiently with new systems such as the cloud.

Technological advancements over recent years have led the majority of companies to have major issues with existing legacy systems. In order to scale and reduce costs, companies need to adapt new technology; although this comes at a price. For companies to keep aligned with the latest technical capabilities, companies need to move away from keeping their legacy system and move to cloud and computing and software migration.

Moving a business through a software migration can be a time consuming and costly process, here we will look at why moving from a legacy system to a software migration is vital for a companies success in 2020.

## Why a Software Migration Strategy is Important

There are multiple reasons a business may be looking to having a software migration; this could be to outperform the competition, or a more agile and efficient internal system. Whatever the reason a company is adopting a new system; the process needs to work.

When looking at an unsuccessful migration, the reasons for this can be from human error; where the inputted data or code is not accurate which can lead to major problems for an organisation. Although this can also when everything has gone according to plan during a software migration also. Most worryingly for a company is when there were no errors within the original software code, or data, and errors present themselves when the code has been inputted into a new, more efficient system.

For example, a system that has been developed with the previous version of .NET or ASP classic, Now we can help to migrate the software and build it from scratch with the latest and cutting-edge technologies e.g. ASP.NET Core which can be run on all OS(s) and React.js systems.

The best way to avoid any major issues within a software migration is to create a software migration strategy for the predicted duration of the project on a week by week basis. Working in agile is of course the most efficient process that a company can use for this process to be a success. The biggest challenges for a software migration strategy can be budgetary, a lack of clear strategy and working in an outdated methodology. The best way to ensure that a strategy is executed in the best way possible is to ensure that there is a dedicated team working full time on the projects until completion. At Communere, we have a full dedicated team of remote employees to help an organisation with their software migration strategy.

Communere work to a tailored strategy for organisation, although it looks something like this:

- Understanding the software Before an effective migration, a complete analysis of the legacy software that has been used, and the software platform that you will be moving to is completed to ensure you're receiving a tailored software plan.
- Cleanup The source software is checked for anomalies, cleaned up in order to be able to effectively start the software migration plan.

- Continuous Maintenance Software regularly has new bugs (even with the best code in the world!) which needs regular maintenance to ensure your product works efficiently and most importantly, that customers data is safe

- Best Practice & Governance We follow the latest international standards for best practice and governance to ensure a well built and efficient product that adheres to high quality standards.

## Best Practices for Software Migration

- Back up the software before executing. The most important part of the process. Ensuring the software has been backed up before starting.

- Keep strategy. Ensuring that the strategy is upheld throughout the process to ensure the project runs smoothly will help both the cost and time of the migration

- Test the Software. Throughout the process of the software migration, ensure that the code is being tested as you go.

## Migrating Software to the Cloud

Ensuring that your dedicated developer is skilled in uploading the code to the cloud will protect your companies code and data in the long run. The cloud has many major benefits for an organisation allowing scalability and growth. Communere is equipped to enable your software migration process.
